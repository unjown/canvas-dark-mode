<h1>Is Canvas Dark Mode Not Working?</h1>

<h3><i>Canvas is still light mode!</i></h3>
<p>After installing, try refreshing the canvas page.</p>

<h3><i>I refreshed and it's still not working!</i></h3>
<h4>8/24/22 Update {I have a fulltime job now!}</h4>
<p>In the past, I had people email me their school.  I became flooded with emails, so as of now
    the best way is to make a pull request with your school url as a single line addition. <br>
    I am currently developing a better way to streamline requests.  Unfortuantely, I must work around this chrome plugin limitation.
</p>

<p><s>Your school's URL might not be in the list that this plugin has.  
    To add your school, send me an email at 
    <strong style="color: rgb(255, 85, 85);">robd@vt.edu</strong> and please include your school's 
    canvas URL. <i>Eg: https://canvas.vt.edu/</i> <br>
    I update this plugin often and will add your school.

<h3><i>You missed a spot! I see light!</i></h3>
<p>Please include details and screenshots in an issue report on <a style="color: aquamarine;" target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/DeGrandis/canvas-dark-mode/issues/new">github</a>
</p>
<p><s>Every canvas page is slightly different and its very likely there are holes.
    Please sent me an email with a screenshot of the spot I missed and I will
    see what I can do to fix it.</s>
</p>

<p>This plugin is also open source, so if you would like to correct something
    that I missed, make a branch and submit a pull request.  
    This is a great and easy way for CS students to contribute to an open source project!

<h3><i>Why does this plugin disable itself when it updates?!  It's very annoying!</i></h3>
<p>This is a restriction with how chrome plugins deal with security on the URLs they work on.
    When I add your school's URL to this plugin's list, it will trigger an update in which you will have to approve the plugin to work on the 
    new URls.  As a developer, I cannot work around this other than with brute force of adding urls.  
    Chrome does not let me use wildcards in the domain of the URL.  So "canvas.*.edu" is not allowed.  Though if it was, we would not have this issue.
</p>

<h3><i>I am completely satisfied with this dark mode!</i></h3>
<p>Thank you!  That's great to hear.
