## Contributing
If you would like to fix/change any of the styles, your expertise is welcome!  This is an open source project and I hope that users will tweak the extension as they see fit.

### How to locally develop

2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
3. Open `chrome://extensions/` on your browser
4. Click `Load Unpacked`

I will be pushing the updated version to the Chrome Store often.
